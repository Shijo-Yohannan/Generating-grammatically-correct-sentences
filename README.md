# Generating-grammatically-correct-sentences

Generating a grammatically intelligent is one small step towards the digital assistant understanding the truth in the sentence generated. Analysing the truth to the sentences helps the assistant to find connections between words. In other words, the code becomes intelligent, and when interacted with, it will be able to reply with sentences that are not only grammatically correct but also meaningful to the context. In this project I am doing the most basic of all with the concepts that have been taught, generating grammatically correct sentences but without checking for the truth of the sentence

## Introduction

The code generates a random number, picking a word from a series of files in chronological logical order. The idea is to chose the right file with the random word chosen. Running the code each time generates a random grammatically correct sentence. One such sentence would be God is a frog or God is an eliphant, which is grammatically correct but does not have to make sense

## Install:

Download or clone the repo.  

Download C++ Compiler : [Turbo C](https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/)

Install gcc compiler in ubuntu like I did
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install manpages-dev
```
To validate the installation check for the version installed
`gcc --version`
